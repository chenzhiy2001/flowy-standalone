- fix `yarn add node-sass` problem <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60394291/error-node-modules-node-sass-command-failed>
- [x] upgrade to tauri <https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/setup/integrate/>
- LaTeX Support
- Links & Backlinks

- [x] Empty lines can promote/demote
    - This is automatically fixed after I ported the project to tauri. Maybe some intent JS library problems are being fixed without my intention.


- Exchange blue dots & pins. Then turn pins into menu list(make it like roam research)
- No checkbox in all lines

- cargo tauri dev command needs extra return

- use `tauri_plugin_sql`
